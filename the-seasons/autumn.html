                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The final movement of The Seasons begins with the "Feather theme From <i>Forrest Gump</i>." This shows the beginning of the leaves on the trees beginning to fall to the ground gracefully. The mood shifts to an eerie, dark one as Halloween approaches in "Excerpt from "Toccata and Fugue." However, once again, after Halloween and through Thanksgiving, the leaves are still falling, as shown in "Autumn's Theme." Christmas is right around the corner as "Jingle Bells" begins. It starts out with a light, innocent sound, but is taken over by a quicker and more excited tone as more instuments join in. "Triumph of the Skies" from The Movement of Spring has a short reprise to show the triumph of Jesus being born on Christmas Day. Finally, the full "New Year's Clock Theme" wraps up The Movement of Autumn and The Seasons, mimicking a clock's chime. The clock strikes midnight with twelve tones, and the cyclical year's full circle is complete. The Movement of Winter begins with the exact same twelve clock chimes.</p>
