                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>The Movement of Spring comes right after the strong, powerful end to The Movement of Summer that shows the destrution and confusion nature can give. "Spring Mist" represents light, tiny water droplets slowly cascading downward from the sky. Next, "The Sunrise" illustrates the sun's first exposure after a long winter of being obscured behind a layer of gray. The sun is slowly and carefully revealing itself in a shy manner. Then, the sun finally fully shines on the world after being hidden for so long. "The Resurrection" also represents the Son's actual resurrection on Easter, where He, like the sun, begins to shine once again after being obscured by the clouds. "The Scramble for Summer" follows, showing the sudden, organized, and unstoppable march toward summer after spring initially was in a slow trance. Finally, "Triumph of the Skies" illustrates the sun being in full blaze, ready for summer, and the victorious end to the battle between the sun and the clouds.</p>
