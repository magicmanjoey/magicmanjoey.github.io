                <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>After the sun emerges victorious from the clouds in The Movement of Spring, it is now summer. The first piece, "The Beach," paints a portrait of a summer vacation. The main eight-measure melody describes the relaxation of a vacation on the beach or even at a pool. The first four-measure verse shows the excitement of being in a different place and seeing new sights. The second verse continues the mood of the first verse with an added feeling of awe and amazement at the beauty of the ocean. "The Star Spangled Banner" comes next. This interesting arrangement represents the Fourth of July, the United States' Independence Day. Finally, "Lonely Desert Scorch" gives the feeling of the unrelenting heat of the sun in a desert that is empty except for the occasional small creature scrambling about, not wanting to be fried. The end of this piece and the end of the movement show the sun beginning to cool as summer draws to an end.</p>
