		<h3>A Fully Orchestrated Album by Joey Steele</h3>
		<p>In this four-movement song, the four seasons of the year are replicated with a multitude and variety of instruments. The first movement, Winter, begins with a clock theme, imitating a clock striking midnight (12 chimes) to bring in the new year. From there, the listener is taken through a journey through the entire year, with simple songs and complex ones all conveying the mood of each moment of the year. The conclusion to the fourth movement begins with a different clock chime, then concluding with the same 12 chimes that brought in the new year, creating a complete cycle. This effectively means that one can begin listening at any movement and, after hearing all four, still take on the full value of the music.</p>
